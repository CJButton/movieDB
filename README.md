## What is this?

This is a React app with the aim of leveraging the [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). We can search for films, television shows, and people. 

Challenges in this short project were:
* Waiting for The Movie DB to fix their API on Saturday morning.
* Lazy loading of images
* Truncating long text
* Updating the URL after searching
* Getting the 'Enter' key to fire searches using hooks.
* Having a colored line to display popularity of viewed item.
* Placeholder images if none was available.
